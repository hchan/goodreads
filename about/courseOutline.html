== Course Outline for BCIT's BackboneJS course

== CREDITS
3

== GOALS
To focus on buliding front-end webapps based off of an exsiting backend service (REST).
Students will have the option of adding the site they created as part of their online portfolio
that can be viewed publically (INTERNAL BCIT NOTE: public site will be Github Pages ... github's
Google gh-pages branch)

== OUTCOMES
* students will be able to create AJAX requests (CRUD, Create/READ/UPDATE/DELETE) to a remote server
(INTERNAL BCIT NOTE: the remote backend service I will be using is: https://www.goodreads.com/api)
* students will be able to setup a proxy to enable CORS (Cross Origin Resource Sharing)
(INTERNAL BCIT NOTE: students will be testing 99% of their code via file:///... to bypass the 
SOP (Single-Origin-Policy) violoation, I'll be using http://www.corsproxy.com/)
* students will be able to upload their project to a SCM (Source Code Management - Git will be used)
(INTERNAL BCIT NOTE: I noticed that Git is introduced in COMP1950 - this should help.  I further recommend
that Git be the default SCM used throughout BCIT.  I'm also using Git for my Java course)
* students will be able to publish their work to be publically viewable site
(INTERNAL BCIT NOTE: github pages)
* students will be able to write Routers in BackboneJS
* students will be able to write Views in BackboneJS
* students will be able to write Model/Collections in BackboneJS
* students will be able to load JavaScript modules via AMD (Asynchronous Module Definitions - RequireJS)
* students will be able to render their views with a templating language (HandlebarsJS)
* students will be able to test and consume REST services without BackboneJS (SOAPUI and/or Firefox with plugins)
