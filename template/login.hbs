The frame below will ask for your OAuth permission to use the Goodreads WRITE API.
If you are not already signed in to Goodreads, then please do so in the frame below.
Afterwards, that frame will redirect you to http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OAuth
meaning that your token has been accepted.
This top frame is currently polling the bottom frame to turn to : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OAuth

This Out-Of-Band frame is known as the Authorize URL in OAuth1.0.
Only after the authorization is complete will the fetchAccessToken API be available.
After authorization is complete, this app will fetch the access token and store it in 
<a href="http://diveintohtml5.info/storage.html">localStorage</a>

I arbitrarily chose http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OAuth as the callback page(a setting in
the Goodreads app settings).  If we had an intermediate server (well, besides CORSProxy), the callback will
be this intermediate server and the action of the Done Button (fetchAccessToken) should be moved there.
