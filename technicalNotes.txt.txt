- We are using CORS (Cross Origin Resource Sharing) to bypass the SOP (Single Origin Policy)
- to be more exact, we are using a CORS Proxy (http://www.corsproxy.com)
-- my gut feel is that the corsproxy adds something along the lines to the HTML Header response
	resp.setHeader("Access-Control-Allow-Credentials", "true");
	resp.setHeader("Access-Control-Allow-Origin", "*"); // CORS
	resp.setHeader("Access-Control-Allow-Methods", "GET,PUT,POST,DELETE,OPTIONS");
	
- OAuth1.0 with CORS gets a bit tricky.  Why?  Because OAuth will create a signature for each request
using the GIVEN url.  If the GIVEN url is the proxyURL, this is wrong.  Therefore, we have to sign with
the REAL URL.  i.e. the the http request to the proxy, but sign with the nonProxy URL

- In the OAuth1.0 spec (do a google with oauth diagram), there is an OOB (Out of Band) Authorization
Basically this means that you will either have to use a frame/pop-up with a URL that will ask then end user for permission.
This frame/pop-up should NOT be proxied.  ONLY after you completed
the OOB authentication can you retrieve an Access Token.
- This access token will then be stored in localStorage
- this app will not work locally with IE
- for chrome, you must use the --disable-web-security flag
